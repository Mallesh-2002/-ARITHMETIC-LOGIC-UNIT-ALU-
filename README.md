The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a core component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It performs the actual arithmetic and logical operations that make up all computer processes.Typically, the ALU has direct input and output access to the processor controller, main memory (random access memory or RAM in a personal computer) and input/output devices. Inputs and outputs flow along an electronic path that is called a bus. The input consists of an instruction word, sometimes called a machine instruction word, that contains an operation code or "opcode," one or more operands and sometimes a format code. The operation code tells the ALU what operation to perform and the operands are used in the operation. The following are a few examples of bitwise logical operations and basic arithmetic operations supported by ALUs: Addition (Adds A and B with carry-in or carry-out sum at Y), Subtraction (Subtracts B from A or vice versa with the difference at Y and carry-in or carry-out), AND (The bitwise logic AND of A and B is represented by Y), OR (The bitwise logic OR of A and B is represented by Y), Exclusive-OR (The bitwise logic XOR of A and B is represented by Y). ALU shift functions cause A or B operands to shift, either right or left, with the new operand represented by Y. Complex ALUs utilize barrel shifters to shift A or B operands by any number of bits in a single operation.
